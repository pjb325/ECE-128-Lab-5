# ECE-128-Lab-5

The prupose of this lab is to create a sytem that can detect a number that is divisable by 2 or 3 in a four bit input.
This will be acheived using The Verilog Programing Language's case statements, which will cycle through the potential inputs,
and set the outpus accordingly. The signal that shows the input is divisable by 3 is LED0 (it will turn on), and the signal that
shows the input is divisable by 2 is LED1. The four bit input will be made using the first four switches on the FPGA board. There
will also be a testbench which will simulate the outputs by cycling through every potential input and call on the main project_5 
module to determine the output.
